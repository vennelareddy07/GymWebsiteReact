            <div className="descpt">Workout Description</div>
            <div className="descpt2">It’s always great when we can take care of two things simultaneously. Life doesn’t work that way, but it can work when it comes to training. For example, many women are looking for ways to train with the goals of getting stronger and leaner.

While this program won’t help you win a powerlifting meet or a physique show, it will help you burn a lot of calories in a short time, and you may notice that you’re getting stronger in the process. 

The program that follows will be for six weeks, three times a week. You can do it on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule, or you can take two days off between sessions. The only requirement is that you not train two days in a row. Recovery matters just as much as training, and doing a routine like this for three days in a row will wear you out quickly, which isn’t a good thing if strength and conditioning matter.</div>
<div className="descpt3">Warming Up</div>
<div className="descpt4">Don’t jump straight into this. Go on a quick walk or do some light cardio for around ten minutes to help you warm up. After that, take a few minutes to stretch the entire body out. Start at the feet and work your way up until all the major muscle groups have received attention. Now, you’re ready to get after it</div>

<div className="descpt34">Ways to Track Progress</div>
<div className="descpt41" >How can you tell that you’re getting better? There are several ways to gauge your progress. Look at your strength first. Are the weights you used in the first workout feeling lighter now? Then, congratulations, you’re getting stronger.

You might find that by the end of the sixth week that you’re capable of doing more. That means your conditioning is getting better as well. That is the goal, right? Of course, there are other metrics such as weight loss, body composition, the ways clothes fit, and so on. Find the ways that will motivate you the most without beating yourself up if the number isn’t what you want it to be. Don’t rely on the scale alone.</div>
