                        <li>Protein requirements are higher for bodybuilders than the average Joe because protein molecules repair damaged muscle fibers in the body and support hormones in the body.</li>
                        <li>Good sources of protein are poultry (25 grams in 3 ounces) and fish (20 grams in 3 ounces). Those who prefer to avoid meat can try soybeans (20 grams per cup) and legumes like beans, peanuts and chickpeas (about 15 grams per cup). Eggs, Greek yogurt, cheese and tofu are good sources, too.</li>

            <li>Carbs for the average workout — If you are in good shape and want to fuel a daily, light-intensity workout, eat about 3 to 5 grams of carbohydrates for every kilogram of body weight. For someone who weighs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) that's between 200 and 340 grams a day.</li>
        
            <li>Carbs for longer workouts — If you exercise more than an hour a day, you may need 6 to 10 grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight. For a 150-pound person, that's 408 to 680 grams a day.</li>
            <li>Pick healthy carbs like brown rice, quinoa, whole-grain bread and pasta, sweet potatoes, fruits, and vegetables.</li>

                        Fat is a confusing topic for many people. But it's essential to a healthy diet. Fat provides energy and helps your body absorb vitamins. Some vitamins (like A, D, E and K) actually need fat to properly benefit your body.

                        <li>
                        Be sure to pick unsaturated fats. Good sources are avocado, olive and canola oils, flaxseed and nuts.

                        Focus on carbohydrates as all pre-workout meals or snacks to provide the body with energy to last the full session. So, if energy levels are sub-optimal, then performance will suffer and have a consequent impact on our rate of adaptation.

                        <li>
                        For example, white bread, jam, granola, cereal, sports drinks, and fruit are all viable options for a pre-workout, energy-boosting snack.

                        The purpose of post-workout nutrition is two-fold, firstly, to promote muscle recovery and secondly to replenish energy. Therefore, the focus should once again be on consuming good quality protein and carb foods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        High-protein foods such as lean beef, chicken, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, seeds, quinoa, and nuts should be prioritized. Also, protein supplements, like protein shakes and bars, can serve as a convenient tool for effectively boosting protein intake.
